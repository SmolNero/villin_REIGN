- Unlike languages like Python or Javascript automatically decide interger types. 

Memory optimization:

Type	Bits	Value Range
----    ----    -----------
u8	8-bit	0 to 255
i8	8-bit	-128 to 127
u16	16-bit	0 to 65,535
i16	16-bit	-32,768 to 32,767
u32	32-bit	0 to 4,294,967,295
i32	32-bit	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
u64	64-bit	0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
i64	64-bit	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

- api_key: String
    - String is a heap-allocated, growable text type
    - &str (string slice) :: it would require a fixed reference string
