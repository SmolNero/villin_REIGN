## Mission Statement

villin_REIGN empowers military and defense organizations with a secure, reliable, and efficient framework for protecting Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) communications, ensuring operational integrity while minimizing cybersecurity vulnerabilities in mission-critical environments.

## Core Capabilities

- **Military-Grade Security**: Zero-trust architecture with advanced encryption
- **Protocol Sovereignty**: Command over multi-protocol battlefield communications
- **Real-Time Protection**: Instant threat detection and response
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized for battlefield deployment
- **Compliance Ready**: Built for military security standards

## Technical Foundation

```rust
pub struct REIGN_CORE {
    encryption: MilitaryGradeEncryption,
    authentication: ZeroTrustAuth,
    monitoring: RealTimeThreatDetection,
}

impl REIGN_CORE {
    pub fn new() -> Result<Self, SecurityError> {
        // Implementation with military-grade security
    }
}
```

## Deployment Hierarchy
